## Community Feedback / Safety Tips 🛡️

> “On newer Windows versions, you can also use WinGet. Open a terminal (press [Win] + [X]) and click ‘Windows Terminal’ or ‘PowerShell’ to grab the latest build.” – *r/lua* tipster

> “WeAreDevs’ executor is minimal and extremely safe. No keys or bootstraps needed, which is rare in this scene.” – *Community user feedback*

Use smart scripts from trusted sources and avoid public pastebins unless you verify the code first. Always run Lua in a sandboxed environment when testing.
